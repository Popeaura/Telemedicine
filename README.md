# Telemedicine

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Telemedicine Platform** that includes features such as user authentication, patient management, doctor scheduling, appointment booking, and data security. The goal of this platform is to make healthcare accessible remotely by connecting patients and doctors seamlessly.

The project is being developed in multiple phases, with the frontend already completed. Currently, I am focusing on the **backend** and **server-side** development to handle the dynamic functionalities required for the application.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Markup for structure
- **CSS**: Styling for user interface
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to the frontend

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: Server-side environment to run JavaScript
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to build the RESTful API
- **MySQL**: Database to store user and healthcare-related data
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure user authentication

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for patients and healthcare providers
- **Doctor Scheduling**: Patients can book appointments with doctors based on availability
- **Appointment Management**: Manage scheduled appointments for both doctors and patients
- **Patient Management**: Keep track of patient information, medical records, and visits
- **Responsive Design**: Frontend is mobile-friendly and adaptive to different screen sizes

## Project Status
As of now, the **frontend** has been completed, and I am working on the **backend** and **server-side** functionality to bring the dynamic features to life. These include:
- **Setting up the backend server**
- **Creating API routes for user authentication, appointment booking, and scheduling**
- **Integrating MySQL database for data persistence**
- **Implementing JWT-based authentication for security**
